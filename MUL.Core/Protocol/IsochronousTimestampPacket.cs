	/// 	The value in the Type field is Isochronous Timestamp Packet for an ITP. 
	/// 	ITPs are used to deliver timestamps from the host to all active devices. 
	/// 	ITPs carry no addressing or routing information and are multicast by hubs 
	/// 	to all of their downstream ports with links in the U0 state. A device shall 
	/// 	not respond to an ITP. ITPs are used to provide host timing information to devices 
	/// 	for synchronization. Note that any device or hub may receive an ITP. The host shall 
	/// 	transmit an ITP on a root port link if and only if the link is already in U0. Only 
	/// 	the host shall initiate an ITP transmission. The host shall not bring a root port 
	/// 	link to U0 for the purpose of transmitting an ITP. The host shall transmit an ITP 
	/// 	in every bus interval within tTimestampWindow from a bus interval boundary if the 
	/// 	root port link is in U0. The host shall begin transmitting ITPs within 
	/// 	IsochronousTimestampStart from when the host root portâ€™s link enters U0 from the polling 
	/// 	state. An ITP may be transmitted in between packets in a burst. If a device receives an 
	/// 	ITP with the delayed flag (DL) set in the link control word, the timestamp value may be 
	/// 	significantly inaccurate and may be ignored by the device.
